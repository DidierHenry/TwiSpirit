# TwiSpirit
TwiSpirit is based on AnalyzeWords (http://analyzewords.com/) an online tool which helps to reveal Twitter users personality by looking at how they use words.

The user personality is described according to 3 styles: the emotional style, the social style and the thinking style.

There are 4 attributes according to the emotional style:

- Upbeat: Lots of positive words and "we" talk. You've got energy, kid, if you ranked high in "upbeat",
  
- Worried: Anxious language dominates your Tweets, as do nervous questions,
 
- Angry: Short of constantly writing in all caps, someone high in the "angry" category uses hostile words and talks a lot to YOU,
 
- Depressed: Lots of self-references and frequent use of depressive words.

There are 4 attributes according to the social style:

- Plugged In: Socially engaged. A category reserved for prolific Tweeters; you scored high in this area if you use social words and include frequent shoutouts to your friends,

- Personable: Engaged in other people's well-being and at peace with expressing your own uncertainty about the world. High scorers in personable use positive emotion words, ask questions, express their own ambivalence and reference others frequently,

- Arrogant/Distant: Well-read and smart with an arms-length approach to socializing. You scored high in this category if you discuss actions instead of emotions, use big words and don't reference yourself much,

- Spacy/Valley girl: Excitable! If you rank high in valley girl; you love recounting your newest story with a lot of LOLLLLLLLLLLs!!!!!!!!!!!


There are 3 attributes according to the thinking style:

- Analytic: If law school exams were a person, they would rank real high in this category. Ample large words and phrases that include complex thinking styles,

- Sensory: A tendency to reference your feelings and surrounding environment,

- In-the-moment: Grounded in what's hot now, with tweets that breezily reference today.
